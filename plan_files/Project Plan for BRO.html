<h1>CP1406 2015 - BRO Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group name undecided</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Miguel Verroya, Charlie Schot, Junpeng Gao</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The new Barrier Reef Orchestra website aims to increase the amount of new members and to keep them actively engaged in their activities. It also intends to increase ticket sales and encourage performers to become more active. This site will provide the necessary exposure to facilitate this.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success will be evaluated by measuring the increase in new members and ticket sales after the launch of the site. For example, an observable figure could be an increase of ticket sales by 100%.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>	The site will be designed in such a way that will appeal to anyone who is interested in joining the orchestra or anyone that is looking for tickets to shows to the orchestra in the Queensland region. The website's layout, colour theme and easy navigation will contribute to reaching this target demographic.</p>
