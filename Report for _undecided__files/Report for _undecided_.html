    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The new Barrier Reef Orchestra website aims to increase the amount of new members and to keep them actively engaged in their activities. It also intends to increase ticket sales and encourage performers to become more active. This site will provide the necessary exposure to facilitate this.</p>
    <h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>

        <li><strong>Miguel Verroya: Mainly worked on the javascript sections of the website and some CSS </strong></li>
        <li><strong>Charlie Schot: Mainly worked on the HTML/CSS to fill the pages with content such as the 'supporters' page and the 'people' page </strong></li>
		<li><strong>Junpeng Gao: Mainly worked on the HTML/CSS to fill the pages with content such as the 'about us' page and the 'news' page. </strong></li>

    <h2>PMI</h2>

    <p><strong>Pluses: Splitting up everyone to do different tasks was a big plus, as we got things done very efficiently and quickly, and every time we had a group meeting someone had something that they had contributed to the website.  </strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: Due to the fact everyone had split up, we didn't really see what other people had created until the next group meeting, sometimes some pages were not how we envisoned them, and we had to change that. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: The interesting aspects of the teamwork process is how well everything melded together at the end, everything on the website looks exactly how we want it to look, we did not expect the finished project to be as good as it is. </strong></p>
